# Read in budget.csv to begin PyBank analysis and create header as variable

# create a series of counters and variables to enable:
    month count
    profit/loss sum
    profit/loss change average
    max profit/loss change
    min profit/loss change

# create aggregator to calculate, similar in concept to month counter, and aggregate the monthly profit/loss values

# write each individual month profit/loss to a new list and calculate mean. Use default functions to calculate max and mean.

# initiate for loop to calculate the month over month profit/loss, starting on index 1 (2nd month) since 1st month of data will have nothing to compare

# calculate the month over month profit/loss
        
# create additional list with profit/loss change so can zip file and have record align with month file. Calculating the month over month change reduces record count by one. Insert value of zero in list to zip with month list. This will allow the proper alignment of month over month change with the correct month.

# zip lists to create tuple with month and profit/loss month over month change. this needs to be converted to a list. Once this is done calculate the max and min change in profit/loss and do a for loop to find the month the max/min occured.


# Create a series of variables to support printing to terminal and text file as required. Write file to text file.
