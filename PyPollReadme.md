# Read in election_data.csv to begin PyPoll analysis and create header as variable

# create a series of counters and lists to enable:
    vote count
    unique list of candidates
    vote count by candidate
    candidate with most votes

# Use set function to run through entire data set and collect unique set of candidates

# use iterator to count votes by candidate and percent of votes received.

# create list of variables to support print to terminal and text file

# use max function to id winner

# use for loop to support printing of candidates, votes recieved and % received

# print to terminal and text file
